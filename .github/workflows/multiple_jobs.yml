    # 2nd Job: Test
    test:
      # The test job will be dependent on the successful completion of the build job

      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      # Defining the steps to be executed in the test job
      steps:
        # Step1: Sleep for 10 seconds to simulate a testing process
        - name: Sleep for 10 Seconds
          run: sleep 10

        # Step 2: Check if the file dragon.txt exists and contains the word "dragon"
